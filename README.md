Student Management System
A simple CLI-based Student Management System built using Python and Pandas, with JSON-based persistent storage.
This project allows you to add, update, delete, view, and save student records using a clean interactive menu.

Features
Load & save student data automatically using JSON
Add new students with auto-generated IDs
Update any student field
Delete student records
View all students in a clean table
Save & exit / Exit without saving
How It Works
Student data is stored in a JSON file and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame with columns:

id, name, age, grade, email, address

If the JSON file doesn’t exist or is invalid, the program initializes an empty dataset with the required headers.

Functions Overview
load_data(path): Loads JSON data and ensures all columns exist
save_data(data, path): Writes DataFrame back to JSON
create_new_rec(data): Generates next student ID
add_studentRec(...): Adds a new student record
update_student_rec(...): Updates existing record fields
delete_student_rec(...): Deletes a student by ID
print_students(data): Displays all records
main(): Runs the interactive CLI menu
Menu Options
List all
Add student
Update student
Delete student
Save and exit
Exit without saving
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
Installing dependencies
Simply run: python -m pip install pandas

Running the program
Download and put all the files into one folder
open cmd in that folder and run python ./main.py
Notes
Handles missing or corrupted JSON gracefully
Ensures all default columns exist
Clean, beginner-friendly CRUD implementation
Uses Pandas for data manipulation and JSON for storage
